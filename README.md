# Overview

This is an image manipulation program for C++ written with OpenCV. It loads an image and allows you to adjust sliders, view a histogram and shift tint and temp. I wanted to make something in C++ because I know it's widely used and have experience with C#, and wanted to see what the differences would be.

# Development Environment

The project uses C++ with the OpenCV package.

# Future Work

This project was just to help me learn a bit of OpenCV and get some practice with C++

- The sliders are very unsightly and could use some aesthetic clean up.
- The color shift function could use a visual aid to indicate how the color will shift when the slider is used.
- Better file integration and loading would help instead of having to hardcode in the image file.
- Other aesthetic and UI upgrades also would make it look much better.
